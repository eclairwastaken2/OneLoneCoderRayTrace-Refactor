My attempt at understanding how to write C++ code by refactoring onelonecoder ray tracing code: 
OneLoneCoder code can be seen here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS/blob/master/CommandLineFPS.cpp

Separate files by concerns: 
1. Config/Constants
2. Player state
3. World/map
4. Raycasting/Rendering
5. Platform
